## II. Portfolio 2 : CORONA_VIRUS(2020_2021)
Hello, I have a Portfolio about CoronaVirus data from 2020-2021. In this Portfolio, I have completed a full project including data cleaning, EDA data exploration in SQL, and data visualization in Tableau.

Dataset Link: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/covid?tab=table&time=2020-03-01..latest&country=IND~USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~FRA&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&hideControls=false&Metric=Excess+mortality+%28estimates%29&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+population=true

Or I accessed Our World in Data's data on github: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

### Data Cleaning and EDA Data Exploration in SQL
First, I divided the data into 2 different CSV files, including CovidDeaths file and CovidVaccinations table. Then, I performed queries in MySQL according to:

1. Countries
- Death rate/infection cases
- Death rate/infection cases in Vietnam (Likelihood of death if you contract covid in your country)
- Percentage of population infected with covid
- Countries with the highest infection rates per population
- Countries with the highest death counts

2. Continents
- Continents with the highest death counts

3. Global: Not divided by continent or country
- Total new cases, total new deaths, and global death rate by day

4. Vaccination numbers
- Total number of people vaccinated by country
- Rolling total of people vaccinated by country
- Percentage of population in each country vaccinated by rolling total

5. Other components
- Are there any differences between countries with high Human Development Index and countries with low Human Development Index?
- What is the relationship between the rate of fully vaccinated people and the new death rate?
  

### Data Visualization using Tableau
After cleaning and analyzing the EDA process, I created 4 different visualization charts in Tableau about:

- Chart 1 - Text Table: Comparison table of Total cases, Total deaths, and Death percentage worldwide
- Chart 2 - Bar chart: Chart showing which continent has the highest death count
- Chart 3 - Maps: Percentage of population infected per country
- Chart 4 - Line: Prediction of percentage increase in infected population across countries
- Chart 5 - Bar chart: Total deaths compared to HDI index of country groups
